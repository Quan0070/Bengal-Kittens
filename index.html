Bengal Cats are the most beautiful and exciting cats to own, and we raise them with all the love and socialization that they need to grow into the perfect little lap leopard for your home. Our kittens come to you completely veterinarian health checked and with health guarantee. All cats are TICA registered. Bengal are descendants of the Asian Leopard cat bred to a domestic cat. This gives them their “wild” spotted coat, and well as their love of heights and their skill at reaching them. Contact us to learn about this amazing breed and to see if one is right for you! Excellent with kids and dogs too!</p>
